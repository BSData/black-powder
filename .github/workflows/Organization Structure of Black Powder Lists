Orginazation for Black Powder Armies 
Top level selection entries include Brigades, and Division Commanders, next level is the standard unit for the brigade, under that there is seperate groups for the stanadard
version of the unit, and another group for all the upgraded versions (this is to be able to limit upgrades if need be). 
Nexxt to the stanard unit for the brigade should be attatched battalions/companies, attatched artillery, and the brigade commander

Since unit upgrades change the stat line of a unit in Black Powder, we will not be using upgrades on a unit.
